XKit themes for Tumblr
=============

A series of CSS files that themes your Tumblr Dashboard. Those are made for XKit, but Stylish will equally do. Tested with XKit and Google Chrome.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Get [XKit](http://xkit.info/), [Stylish](http://userstyles.org/) or anything that lets you put a custom CSS on your dashboard
2. If you installed XKit, install the Theme Editor from the Get Extensions tab.
3. Choose a CSS from the repo and put it as custom theme. If you got Stylish, make sure the URL is set to http://www.tumblr.com/, you don't want to style the subdomains.
4. ????
5. PROFIT!

If you're the XKit guy and you're reading this, feel free to add any of my themes to the Themes extension.
